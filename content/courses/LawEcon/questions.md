**Instructions**: 

- For these questions, there are no right or wrong answers. There are, however, better and worse arguments you can make. 
- Feel free to use any source of information that you want, but I recommend that you first spend some time thinking about the question on your own. 
- Try to convey your answer concisely and clearly.
