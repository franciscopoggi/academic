        </font>  <b>I'm co-organizing the 2023 annual conference of the Competition Law and Economics European Network (CLEEN)</b>
</summary>
The Mannheim Centre for Competition and Innovation (MaCCI), the Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224 EPoS at the universities of Bonn and Mannheim, and ZEW Mannheim are pleased to announce the 2023 annual conference of the Competition Law and Economics European Network (CLEEN).

CLEEN is a joint effort of eight academic institutions in Europe:
<ul>
  <li>Amsterdam Center for Law & Economics (ACLE) at the University of Amsterdam</li>
  <li>Bergen Center for Competition Law and Economics (BECCLE) at the Norwegian School of Economics and the University of Bergen</li>
  <li>Centre for Competition Policy (CCP) at the University of East Anglia</li>
  <li>Centre for Market and Public Organisation (CMPO) at the University of Bristol</li>
  <li>Mannheim Centre for Competition and Innovation (MaCCI) at the University of Mannheim and ZEW Mannheim</li>
  <li>Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods, Bonn</li>
  <li>Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute, Florence</li>
  <li>Tilburg Law and Economic Center at Tilburg University</li>

It has provided an interdisciplinary platform for researchers in the field of law and economics since its first research workshop in Bonn in 2007. CLEEN organizes an annual conference for Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers from economics and law to present their work on competition law, economics, and policy and receive feedback from senior faculty members.

According to current planning, the 2023 CLEEN Conference will be held in person in Mannheim.

          Draft coming soon:
        </font> <b> Rewarding Scientific Discoveries </b>
</summary>
This paper develops a normative theory of scientific compensation. A sequence of short-lived agents decide how to approach a process of scientific discovery. Agents can engage in applied research, that might produce something of intrinsic value, or basic research, that produces information about the world. Basic research is valuable because  guides the posterior allocation of resources in the applied research process. Considering a principal that provides incentives through monetary payments, I give conditions under which the agents can be induced to approach discovery efficiently, and in a way that is robust to agents' beliefs and lifespan. Moreover, I show that, in order to provide these incentives, positive findings (those who indicate that a certain research direction is promising) should be rewarded more handsomely than negative findings (that show that a certain research direction is futile).
