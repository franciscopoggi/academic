I am a microeconomic theorist. My research focuses on the incentives to acquire, elicit, disclose, and conceal information. I am interested in industrial organization, law, and innovation.

I am an Assistant Professor (W1) at the [University of Mannheim - Department of Economics](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) and received my Ph.D. from Northwestern University (2021).

</summary>
<br>
We investigate a firm's incentives to conceal an intermediate research discovery in order to influence its rival's choice of strategy in an innovation race. To study this, we introduce an innovation game where two firms dynamically allocate their resources between two distinct research and development (R&D) paths towards a final innovation: (i) developing it with the currently available but slower technology; (ii) conducting research to discover a faster new technology for developing it. We fully characterize the equilibrium behavior of the firms in the cases where their research progress is public and private information. Then, we extend the private information setting by allowing firms to conceal or license their intermediate discoveries. We show that when the reward of winning the race is high, firms sometimes conceal their interim discoveries, which inefficiently retards the pace of innovation.

        </font> <b> Rewarding Scientific Discoveries </b>
</summary>
This paper develops a normative theory of scientific compensation. A sequence of short-lived agents decide how to approach a process of scientific discovery. Agents can engage in applied research, that might produce something of intrinsic value, or basic research, that produces information about the world. Basic research is valuable because  guides the posterior allocation of resources in the applied research process. Considering a principal that provides incentives through monetary payments, I give conditions under which the agents can be induced to approach discovery efficiently, and in a way that is robust to agents' beliefs and lifespan. Moreover, I show that, in order to provide these incentives, positive findings (those who indicate that a certain research direction is promising) should be rewarded more handsomely than negative findings (that show that a certain research direction is futile).
