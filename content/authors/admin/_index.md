I am a microeconomic theorist exploring how incentives to acquire, elicit, disclose, and conceal information shape economic interactions. I am interested in innovation, law, and industrial organization.

<br>

I joined the <a href="https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Mannheim</a> as an Assistant Professor (W1) after graduating from Northwestern University (2021).
