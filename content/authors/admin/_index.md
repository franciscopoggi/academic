I am a microeconomic theorist. My research focuses on the incentives to acquire, elicit, disclose, and conceal information. I am interested in industrial organization, law, and innovation.

I work at the [University of Mannheim - Department of Economics](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) as an Assistant Professor (W1) and received my Ph.D. from Northwestern University (2021).

  <b>The Timing of Complementary Innovations.</b> 
  </summary>
  <br>
      This paper studies the dynamic completion of complementary tasks or projects. At each point in time, resources are allocated to projects that are completed as breakthroughs. I solve the problem of efficient dynamic allocation of resources by showing that, for complements, the solution must satisfy a regret-free property. I apply these results to study the problem of innovation when there is uncertainty about the difficulty of innovations. In some cases, the solution involves completing the projects in sequence. In others, it is optimal to work on multiple projects simultaneously. I provide simple conditions that determine the efficient timing of project completion.

We investigate firms’ incentives to conceal intermediate research discoveries in innovation
races. To study this, we introduce an innovation game where two racing firms
dynamically allocate their resources between two distinct research and development
(R&D) paths: (i) developing an innovative product with the currently available technology; (ii) conducting research to discover a faster technology for developing it. We fully characterize the equilibrium behavior of the firms in the cases where their research progress is public and private information. Then, we extend the model by allowing firms to conceal or license their intermediate discoveries. When the reward for winning the race is high, firms may conceal their interim discoveries, which slows down the pace of innovation.

        </font> <b> Rewarding Scientific Discoveries </b>
</summary>
This paper develops a normative theory of scientific compensation. A sequence of short-lived agents decide how to approach a process of scientific discovery. Agents can engage in applied research, that might produce something of intrinsic value, or basic research, that produces information about the world. Basic research is valuable because  guides the posterior allocation of resources in the applied research process. Considering a principal that provides incentives through monetary payments, I give conditions under which the agents can be induced to approach discovery efficiently, and in a way that is robust to agents' beliefs and lifespan. Moreover, I show that, in order to provide these incentives, positive findings (those who indicate that a certain research direction is promising) should be rewarded more handsomely than negative findings (that show that a certain research direction is futile).
